                A bit more about me. I am a gamer, and I like to code for fun. 
                One of the major projects that I have worked on is a text based 
                adventure game all in java. I also enjoy coding in HTML and CSS. 
                One of the other things I do in my free time is to read a large 
                variety of books books. I can't wait to get to know everyone better.
