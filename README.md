# web-dev-starter

 This is the starter project for Web Dev. For this project I made a custom page
 as well as including it in the main index html.

 This project is a starting point for what is to come in the future.


## Viewing the project

 I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
 see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

 In order to view the pop ups you may have to enter into a webpage. If you are using 
 live extention you can copy the link and paste it into a web browser to test it

## Testing

 For testing this project make sure you have run following command

 ```npm install```

 Once you have run that command you can run the following command to check all the tests that
 exist.

 ```npm run test```

 There is one test that has been commented out. This test is for printing to the console. However,
 as I changed it to an alert it can no longer test correctly.
